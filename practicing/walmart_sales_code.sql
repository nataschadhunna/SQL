/* Q4. (a) Why do you think Fuel Price is included in this dataset? 

fuel price probably was included in this dataset as it is a factor that impacts the supply chain cost. if there
were to be high fuel prices then that makes it expensive for walmart to deliver goods from the warehouse to 
individual stores. overall, it is a factor that impacts weekly sales of walmart through supply chain costs.
hence, analysts can see whether higher fuel prices lead to lower sales for individual stores.

(b) What conclusions can be made about Fuel Price compared to any of the other fields? */

/* we find that the strength and direction of the corellation between fuel price and weekly sales vary by 
location. for example, store 38 shows the strongest positive correlation (r = 0.698), suggesting that higher 
fuel prices are associated with higher weekly sales for this store. alternatively, Store 36 exhibits the 
strongest negative correlation (r = âˆ’0.727), indicating that higher fuel prices may reduce customer spending 
or visits at that store, hence lower weekly sales for that store. overall, including Fuel Price in the dataset 
helps capture how external economic conditions can impact store performance across regions for walmart. */
