Here, I am practicing my SQL abilities with projects that have different datasets.

### project 1: walmart project
This project involves me to analyse walmart's sales, where the key focus was to understand how different economic variables affect store performances.

The dataset I used is sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mikhail1681/walmart-sales). I cleaned and standardized the dataset using excel (such as date formatting) before running my analyses on SQL. 

Based on my analysis, I found that Thanksgiving generated the highest weekly sales and the correlation between fuel price and walmart's weekly sales varied by location, indicating potential regional differences in consumer behavior and cost sensitivity.
