# Extreme weather data analysis

## Introduction to the project.
This project analyses weather data from a local station, where I applied SQL to discover trends, extreme conditions and patterns. Through SQL querying and aggregation, I identified  extreme temperature and wind speed thresholds. With time-based analysis, I evaluated monthly weather patterns, including the percentage of days classified as extreme weather. 

The project demonstrates my skills in data cleaning and conditional logic.

I obtained the weather database for this project from [Mary Knoeferl](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7371233708634419200/).
